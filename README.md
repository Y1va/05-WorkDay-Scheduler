# Challenge 05 - Work Day Scheduler


## Description

For this project my class and I were tasked with creating a calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day.

This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically udpated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. We also had to utilise the Day.js library in order to work with the date and time.
